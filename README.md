## Verity Honebon

After studying Classics with an emphasis on ancient languages (Latin, Greek and Cuneiform) at university I spent six years working in arts logistics and exhibitions. During this time I was lucky enough to work on several high-profile projects that combined art and technology including the BBC's Your Paintings database, which displayed digital images of publically owned paintings and allowed the public to tag and, therefore, categorize artworks online and the National Gallery's Soundscapes exhibition, which used acoustic technology to transform the exhibition experience. I joined the June 2017 cohort at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, after a year of self-taught coding to improve my knowledge of code and get a feel for the world of tech with a goal to becoming a Junior Developer.  I would like to work for an organisation whose projects I can really throw myself into and who will support me in my career development.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have strong communication skills which I have developed during my time working in exhibition logistics.  In order to deliver successful exhibitions I had to communicate clearly and frequently with clients to deliver shows that fulfilled their artistic vision within logistical constraints.  I found that as I developed my communication skills I was able to be more flexible - working to changing opening dates and exhibition specifications.  

#### Data analysis

Studying Classics at university was fantastic training in critical thinking and assessing data structures (ancient texts).  While working at the National Gallery I developed these skills by gathering and analysing data, including visitor figures, retail income and wifi tracking, as part of several operational trial projects.  In the summer of 2017 the Gallery changed the locaion of its main entrance based on the analysis I presented to the Board.  This resulted in an upturn in retail and exhibition ticket sales.

## Interests

I'm interested in the application of the arts in unusual fields (healthcare, technology, performance, design etc.) and am co-author on a blog on the subject (https://vantablackart.wordpress.com).  As part of Vantablack I run workshops and events that showcase individuals working on multi-disciplinary arts projects.

I'm an active person - I box, run, play football and practise yoga.
