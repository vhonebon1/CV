# Verity Honebon

I am a creative person who intensely enjoys problem solving.

After six years of working in arts logistics and exhibition design I joined Makers Academy to improve the quality of my code and to challenge myself to learn new skills with like minded people.  In addition to the technical skills I have learned, the course has given me greater confidence in my ability to approach the unfamiliar and a clearer insight into how to continually improve my own learning processes.

I would like to work for a company that values collaboration highly and whose goal is to have a positive impact on the world. 

## Projects

During my time at Makers Academy, I've gone from being a novice coder to being able to confidently build end-to-end web and mobile applications using a range of technologies.  You can find a full list of projects on my Github but below are some of my favourite projects to date:

| Project Name  | Technologies          | Description  |
| ------------- | ----------------------|--------------|
| [Instagram](https://github.com/vhonebon1/instagram-challenge)     | Ruby, Rails, Postgresql and Rspec | Using Rails for the first time I built a (very 90s) clone of Instagram            |
| [Shortkeys](https://github.com/vhonebon1/shortkeys)              | Javascript and Jasmine                      |              I built this programe, which teaches you useful Atom shortcuts, four days into learning Javascript to help me build my skills in the language |
| [Sarca-therapist](https://github.com/MarySalemme/sarca-therapist)  | Javascript, Jasmine, JQuery          |      This group project saw my team build a sarcastic therapist chat-bot without the use of APIs or libraries        |  

## Skills

#### Communication

* In previous roles I organised international and high profile art exhibitions that often had many stakeholders in various locations across the world (including clients, artists, gallery owners and colleagues). The ability to communicate clearly to a large range of people, sometimes on minuscule details, was essential. 
* My goal on starting Makers Academy was to become a great collaborator and an enabler of my own and others' ideas.  I achieved this by tailoring my existing communication skills to pairing and group work, by following the rules of XP Programming and by championing regular standup and retros.


#### Data analysis

* Studying ancient languages at university was very thorough training in critical thinking and data analysis.  There are very clear parallels that can be drawn between writing code and text composition since in both cases structure, content and style must all be carefully considered.  
* While working at the National Gallery I developed my analytical skills by gathering and analysing numerical data, including visitor figures, retail income and wifi traffic, as part of several operational trial projects designed to maximise the Gallery's profit in the face of significant funding cuts.  In the summer of 2017 the Gallery changed the location of its main entrance based on the analysis I presented to the Board.  This resulted in an 6% upturn in retail profit and exhibition ticket sales.  

#### Problem solving

* Problem solving was one of the main things that drew me to coding and it has been the thing I have enjoyed the most during my time at Makers Academy.  I employed very practical problem solving skills at work - no one exhibition was the same and I was often faced with unique logistical constraints, for example shipping to or from unusual locations or working with priceless, large or extremely fragile artworks.  However, I have greatly enjoyed being able to apply my skills to coding and to engage with problems on a more theoretical level.  During the course I have actively sought out extra challenges - such eschewing existing testing frameworks in favour of building my own - and aim to learn new languages as part of this outlook.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June - September 2017)

Highlights of the course:

- Feeding my curiosity and passion for code - demonstrated in my work from the course and my side projects
- Adopting a growth-mindset and becoming more adept at analysing my strengths and potential areas for improvement
- Focusing on best practise and high quality code through OOP, TDD and MVC
- Championing structured communication including daily standups and retros
- Following the principles of agile software development and extreme programming closely
- Using the following technologies: Ruby, Rails, Javascript and Node.js, Clojure
- Using the following testing frameworks: Rspec, Jasmine and custom built assertion libraries

#### London School of Economics Summer School (July - August 2014)
Priniciples of Accounting and Financial Decision Making - Grade A

#### King's College London (September 2008 - August 2011)
Classics BA - 2.1 honours

- Additional modules in Mathematics and Spanish
- Throughout my time at university I taught Latin in primary schools in Hackney as part of the [Iris Project](http://irisproject.org.uk), an educational charity that aims to introduce the languages and culture of the ancient world to UK state schools.
