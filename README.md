After studying Classics with an emphasis on ancient languages at university I spent six years working in arts logistics and exhibition design. During this time I was lucky enough to work on several high-profile projects that combined art and technology including the BBC's Your Paintings website (now Art UK: https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/) and the National Gallery's Soundscapes exhibition, which used acoustic technology to transform the exhibition experience.  It was working on digital arts projects and alongside developers that sparked my interest in the tech world and in coding. I joined the June 2017 cohort at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, after a year of self-taught coding to improve my knowledge of code and get a feel for the world of tech.  My goal is to become a Junior developer and I would like to work for an organisation whose projects I can throw myself into and who will support me in both my personal and career development.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have strong communication skills which I have developed during my time working in exhibition logistics.  In order to deliver successful exhibitions I had to communicate clearly and frequently with clients, artists, colleagues and third parties to overcome logistical constraints and deliver shows that fulfilled the artistic vision.  I found that as I developed my communication skills I was able to be more flexible - working to changing opening dates and complex exhibition specifications.  

#### Data analysis

Studying Classics at university was very thourough training in critical thinking and assessing data structures (in this case ancient texts).  While working at the National Gallery I developed these skills by gathering and analysing data, including visitor figures, retail income and wifi trafic, as part of several operational trial projects.  In the summer of 2017 the Gallery changed the locaion of its main entrance based on the analysis I presented to the Board.  This resulted in an upturn in retail and exhibition ticket sales.

## Interests

I'm interested in the application of the arts in unusual fields (healthcare, technology, performance, design etc.) and am co-author on a blog on the subject (https://vantablackart.wordpress.com).  As part of Vantablack I run workshops and events that showcase individuals working on multi-disciplinary arts projects.

I am also writing a blog that records my thoughts on the transition from the art world to tech: https://medium.com/@verityhonebon

I'm an active person - I box, run, play football and practise yoga.
