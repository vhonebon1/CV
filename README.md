## Verity Honebon

I am a creative person who intensely enjoys problem solving.

After six years of working in arts logistics and exhibition design I joined Makers Academy (MA) to improve the quality of my code and to challenge myself to learn new skills alongside like minded people.  Other than the technical skills I have learned, the course has benefitted me hugely by giving me greater confidence in my ability to approach the unfamiliar and a clearer insight into how to continually improve my own learning processes.

I would like to work for a company that values collaboration highly and whose goal is to have a positive impact on the world.

## Skills

#### Communication

In order to deliver successful exhibitions I had to communicate clearly and frequently with clients, artists, colleagues and third parties in order to deliver shows that fulfilled the artistic vision.  No one exhibition was the same and I was often faced with unique logistical constraints (e.g. shipping to or from unusual locations, working with priceless and extremely fragile artworks, working with people in different time zones) that required excellent communication  and creative problem solving skills to overcome.  My goal on starting MA was to become a great collaborator and an enabler of my own and others' ideas, which I feel I did by tailoring my exisiting comunication skills to pair and group work and by championing regular standup and retros.


#### Data analysis

Studying ancient languages at university was very thorough training in critical thinking and data analysis.  While working at the National Gallery I developed my data analysis skills by gathering and analysing data, including visitor figures, retail income and wifi traffic, as part of several operational trial projects designed to maximise the Gallery profit in the face of significant government funding cuts to the Arts.  In the summer of 2017 the Gallery changed the location of its main entrance based on the analysis I presented to the Board.  This resulted in an 11% upturn in retail profit and exhibition ticket sales.
